## 💬 DEMO TALKING POINTS

### Opening (30 seconds)
*"In emerging markets like Tunisia and across Sub-Saharan Africa, talented individuals face a major barrier: their resumes never reach human recruiters. Up to 70% are rejected by ATS systems due to formatting issues, missing keywords, or poor structure. UtopiaHire solves this problem with AI."*

### Core Value (1 minute)
*"Our system analyzes resumes across 5 dimensions: ATS compatibility, formatting, keyword optimization, and content quality. It then provides specific, actionable suggestions and can even rewrite sections to be more impactful. All processing happens locally for privacy."*

### Live Demo (2 minutes)
*[Show CLI commands, highlight scores, show before/after]*

### Impact (1 minute)
*"This empowers job seekers to optimize their resumes independently, for free, with region-specific guidance. It's accessible, private, and effective."*

### Future (30 seconds)
*"Next phases include job matching, interview preparation, and footprint analysis. We're building a complete career toolkit for the region."*
